  <h1>We Are "3" of a Kind</h1>
  <p>A family of three plus one, currently living in East Van. We like good food, good music, and good company. This space is dedicated to our collective adventures through new-family-hood, Vancouver-living, photography, and anything we are loving at the moment.</p>
  <p>For more of Lois' adventures through geekery and (probably too much information on) motherhood, check out <a href="http://thefishepic.ca">the fish epic</a>!</p>
