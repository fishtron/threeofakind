The rings were mainly Matt's doing. So I'll just post a couple of pictures and describe them generally, and let him tell you all about them (either as a blog post later or when you come over for dinner!).

My ring is also the engagement ring. It has nine stones, three each of sapphires, white diamonds and black diamonds, set to nine interlocking fishes.

Matt's ring is a moebius strip, with a line of rose gold that traces one of the two surfaces (there are two surfaces because it has thickness). Acorns and oak leaves are hand-engraved on the opposite surface.

Our rings match in their wavy shape. I think we have the coolest rings ever, and I love that they are one-of-a-kind, yet they belong together.
