Wedding afterthoughts:

The day after the wedding I got up at ~7am. Everyone that hadn't got up at 5am to catch the early ferry was packing up and leaving slowly. I finally had a chance to visit with some of my family that I hadn't talked to yet during the week end, and I thanked everyone before they left for coming out helping make Lois and my wedding such a great time. It had been so great to see everyone that I didn't realize how special it was until it was too late and everyone was gone. 
A couple weeks later when I was going through all the wedding photos I finally realized just how much everyone helped out and contributed. Despite having already thanked everyone for coming I felt like I need to go and thank everyone again for the contribution I hadn't even known they provided. 
Thank you for your generous help, without you the wedding would not have been as great as it was. 

Love,
Matthew
