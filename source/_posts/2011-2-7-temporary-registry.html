This is a static list that will serve as our temporary registry until Matt and Lois finally code up the registry app. Yes, we're writing it ourselves because we want something simpler yet more flexible than what's available out there. (Perhaps we also like punishment.) (That's not part of the registry, though.)<div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Some nice, sharp, folded-steel knives (like Shun)</li><li>A stick immersion blender</li><li>A Kitchenaid stand-up mixer</li><li>A burr-grinding coffee grinder (no blades)</li><li>Raincheque for a tiny couch</li><li>Bag-less vacuum</li><li>Multi-fuel camping stove (like the Whisperlite)</li><li>Re-usable silicone muffin cups, big and small sizes</li><li>Canning equipment: metal funnel, jar lifter, racks</li><li>Oven mitts</li><li>Heirloom seeds</li><li>Cookbooks: Momofuku, Nobu, Feenie, Vij, Evaleen Roy's _Four Chefs One Garden_, etc.</li><li>Your favourite recipes</li><li><br /></li></ul></div>
