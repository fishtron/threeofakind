To say we're big on food is a bit of an understatement :D Matt and I love food and it was a big deal to get it right.

(This is a picture-heavy post! Watch out if you're reading this on your phone.)

Since we encouraged folks to arrive early, we felt responsible for the breakfast on day 2. We rented a huge barbecue and asked Basil, Blake and Lucas (brothers and friend) to "be in charge." I hid in my cabin because I wasn't supposed to see Matt so I don't know of the exact details, but I heard-tell it turned out pretty grand. Lots of bacon and sausages and eggs and pancakes and fruit were et. We also splurged on a dozen boxes of various Mighty Leaf teas, which were *wonderful*.

Perpetual walks and free pork for Gir. What's not to love?

When it came to dinner, we realised there are many great cooks in our ranks (birds of a hungry, foodie feather) so we thought HEY, let's make use of that! We asked everyone to help prepare a dish, so that the cooking was shared among all the attendees. We ended up with: many salads, veggie dips, several soups (including a big vat of wonton soup! which my mum+dad+grandma made), sausages and steaks and kabobs and way too much fish, several cakes (including a meat cake by Kristen and a tetris cake by Tara) and fresh pies from the market made that morning.

Oh, and libations poured from no fewer than 24 wine bottles and two kegs.
