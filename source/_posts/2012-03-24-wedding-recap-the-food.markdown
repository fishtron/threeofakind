To say we're big on food is a bit of an understatement :D Matt and I love food and it was a big deal to get it right.

(This is a picture-heavy post! Watch out if you're reading this on your phone, you hipster.)

Since we encouraged folks to arrive early, we were responsible for the breakfast on day 2. We rented a huge barbecue and asked Basil, Blake and Lucas (brothers and friend) to "be in charge" -- we left the details up to them. I hid in my cabin because I wasn't supposed to see Matt so I didn't get to be there with everyone, but I heard lots of bacon and sausages and eggs and pancakes and fruit were et. 

Also, perpetual walks and free pork for Gir!

When it came to dinner, we realised there are many great cooks in our ranks (birds of a hungry, foodie feather) so we thought HEY, let's make use of that! We asked everyone to help prepare a dish, so that the cooking was shared among all the attendees. It was a highly organised potluck and by *gods* were we lucky. We had a *mother* of all feasts, with: many salads, cheese, dips, soups (including a big vat of wonton soup! which my mum+dad+grandma made), sausages and steaks and chicken and kabobs and fish, a delicious lasagna, several cakes (including a meat cake by Kristen and a tetris cake by Tara) and fresh pies from the market made that morning. Uncle Bill brought a roast pig that we cut up the day before.

Oh, and libations poured from no fewer than two dozen wine bottles and a couple of kegs. Tea and coffee flowed freely throughout the day and then hot chocolate came around sunset. Everyone was to be *hydrated*. *At all times.*

**Thank you for the fantastic meal and super extra thanks to everyone was a great sport about doing the dishes afterwards!** The hunt to complete each cabin's dishes could have gone so, so wrong (all the dishes can come outside for dinner as long as the same number went back in) but somehow it was almost fun. (M: I don't know if I'd call it fun -- it's certainly memorable though) So thankful for our family and friends being awesome!
