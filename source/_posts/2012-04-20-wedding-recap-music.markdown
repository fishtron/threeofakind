Matt and I were both band geeks in school, so we're lucky to be surrounded by musicians. [Clare Morgan](http://clarityharp.ca) is a friend of mine since high school. She **rocks** the harp. She's very experienced with wedding stuff too, so I barely had to ask for "the wedding package" and it was all set for us.

She brought the bigger of her two harps, Niamh. And she wrote us a beautiful song. (It made more than one of us cry.)

So much <3
