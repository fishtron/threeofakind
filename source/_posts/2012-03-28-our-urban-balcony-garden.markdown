Last weekend was the first sunny one in recent memory, so we hopped in the car and bought a bunch of things to populate our balcony with green things.

Matt built a table for the potted stuff and raised the cedar planter box on a stand so that they can get more sun. We used to have glass and metal railigs on the old balcony so we got away with putting things on the ground, but not so here.

We're really lucky that our balcony is really big for a townhome, and it's south facing and roof-less so we'll be getting tons of light.

So far we've planted two boxes full of lettuce, some green onions and the old oregano that survived the move. There's also a planter hanging over the southern railing which is seeded with chamomile.

We're starting some more seedlings indoor first and then planting them in a week.

Hopefully it will coincide with some rain right away, too.
