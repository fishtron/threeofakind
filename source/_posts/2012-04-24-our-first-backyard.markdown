A few weeks ago we hired [Ron, a really fantastic landscaper](http://www.swicks.net/) to get our bantam backyard ready for spring. Our bedroom is in the basement and opens outside with sliding glass doors.

It was obvious that the previous owners had spent very little time in the yard. They had laid down some new turf for the sale/open house viewings, but left it to brown in the month since the sale completed. (Which was okay since we didn't want to cut grass, but speaks volumes about the sort of stuff that goes on in the real estate market here.)

So in March Matt drew up a detailed plan for Ron, which Ron tweaked with his knowledge of native plants. The work was done just after Easter, in time for the heat wave. Here are the results!

The ornamental cedars are an existing fixture that everyone in our strata are wondering whether to keep because they're a pain to have to cut back every year. They provide good privacy for us from the neighbouring apartment building, but the droppings do turn our soil fairly acidic, limiting our choices for what can go under.

Luckily, cedars are native to BC, which means that there are also lots of native undergrowth that thrive in such conditions. What we got are some bleeding hearts and forget-me-nots for the lovely flowers, and some creeping wild ginger that will hopefully spread into mounds of greenery.

In the far corner is a new trellis with a clamatis surrounding the base of a huge magnolia tree. The magnolia tree blooms spectacularly for about a week before all the petals fall.

Uneven flagstones take us through the yard with moss bits ready to spread throughout the cracks.

The raised vegetable beds are boxed in with rough-cut, untreated red cedar posts... the first week they were laid down, our bedroom smelt *oh so good*. So far we've planted some lettuce and broccoli. The beds get about three hours of evening sun, so we're not sure if they will be productive.

Matt has installed automatic sprinklers all over the yard as well, because the hose is difficult to reach and we were worried about being away for long stretches.
