Our Martha Stewart balls were colourful and fun to make, but they were on the small side. Even if I wanted to make bigger ones, we couldn't find any large sized tissue paper in either Deserres or Michaels in a pinch. 

My mum ordered the miniature potted plants and baskets, and also made the table runners. We rented the table cloths.

The gorgeous and playful cake was made by Aunt Joanna. She was afraid that we wouldn't like the cake because it was too wild -- just the opposite! We loved it. And it was extremely delicious.
