Our [Martha Stewart balls](http://www.marthastewart.com/how-to/tissue-paper-pom-poms-how-to) were colourful and fun to make, but they were on the small side. Even if I wanted to make bigger ones, we couldn't find any large sized tissue paper in either Deserres or Michaels in a pinch.

My mum ordered the miniature potted plants and baskets, and also made the table runners. We rented the table cloths to classy up the picnic tables, which were gathered under the tent with the blessing of the resort managers, and the might (and discomfort) of our friends.

The gorgeous and playful cake was made by Aunt Joanna. She was afraid that we wouldn't like the cake because it was too wild -- just the opposite! We loved it. And it was extremely delicious. The lemon filling and the fondant were mouth-watering. Many came for seconds.

The daisies? The were in full bloom all over the hills around Cusheon. Uncle Dave went hunting for some to add to the cake; as did Marijka and I, but for a slightly different purpose.
