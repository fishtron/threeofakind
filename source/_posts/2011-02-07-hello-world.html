Hacked up this site at 11:30pm on a week-night after a day of training on server admin, listening to some thumping techno, and drinking some sweet soda (ginger beer). If I had one hand inside a bag of crisps I'd be 100% college comp sci dork. Now I'm just slightly more grown-up dork, I guess.<div><br /></div><div>Turns out I *don't* need a GUI to manage my databases. Ha-ha! That was a diversion that I nipped in the bud about thirty minutes in. See? I'm getting more grown-up by the second.</div><div><br /></div><div><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><div>More wedding-related news will come soon. I'm too chipper about getting the site up to not write about it.</div></div>
