Right, the dress. My mum gave me her wedding dress. Her wedding dress! It was a great basis for Marijka to work her magic, and it just adds so much meaning.

<!-- more -->

We spent a few afternoons looking at dresses that would accommodate my growing belly, and agreed that we may need to make last-minute adjustments. But the basic idea is a short A-line dress that draped over my pregnant tummy.

I was surprisingly easy-going about the design, even though I used to spend quite a bit of time dreaming about dresses.

My mum said that I could do whatever I wanted to with her dress (!), including completely cutting it up (!!), so that's what we did.

The sheer fabric was found in Fabricland in North Van. The rest was magic from Marijka. The pictures speak for themselves...
