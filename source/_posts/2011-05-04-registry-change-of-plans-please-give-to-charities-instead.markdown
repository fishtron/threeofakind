After some discussion (and agonising over the lack of good wregistry solutions... but that's mostly Lois) we have decided to *not want gifts*.

To those of you who have already purchased gifts, thank you!

<!--more-->

To those of you who have not yet purchased gifts, please consider donating to our favourite charities/groups:

- BC Cancer Agency
- UBC Farm
- Medicins sans frontieres
- Engineers Without Borders
- SPCA or Dhana Metta Rescue Society
- Wikimedia Foundation
- MercyCorp (e.g. for [http://www.mercycorps.org/japanearthquake](http://www.mercycorps.org/japanearthquake))
- Warchild

We would, however, still love to see your favourite recipes anyway. :-)
