Glimpses from Russell's first five months...

November -- noticing growth every day: rounder head, darker skin, more time with eyes open. Had baby shower near end of month. Lots of stress from baby and moving, though R quickly settled into new home. R's paperwork got done. Outgrowing some clothes already. Started bed-sharing on day 4 and never looked back. Discovered diaper rash. 

December -- R's hunger and sleepy cues are either getting more consistent or we just got better at getting them (or likely both). Christmas... snow... first shots :( after which he had a small fever. Overreacting parents called newborn hotline freaking out about a 38 degree "fever." First reliable smile/grin response to play while being changed -- ah kick kick kick kick! Got Momo Sling.

January -- had thrush scare. Started EC-ing by peeing in sink. Spending 1 day a week with tai-po (great grandma). R giggles to person grinning, noticed own shadow. Slept 4-5 hours in one shift forr 2 weeks in a row before reverting. Noticing his pudge! Enjoys "see-food" and other tongue goofs. Got ERGObaby. Watches me and Matt while we use phone/computer. Diaper rash disappeared at some point.

February -- Babytime at the Library => silly songs and rhymes. Starting making things up to sing when we forget words. Enjoys "falling" down and up. Cries when need to pee/poop sometimes but not reliably. Went swimming, doesn't like it much :( Rolls over on slanted futon with help from giraffe. Arches when nursing because of distraciton, needs to be clamped/lay down nursing.

March -- More swimming! Granny came to swim and R relaxed under her tutelage. Tasted lemon, grapefruit, strawberries, canteloup, ice cream, bacon. Pees more often in potty than not. Rolls over on his own on one side, from front -> back. Does not sleep well at night, escapes from swaddle frequently. Enjoys songs about riding, marching, elevators and cuckoo clocks. Plays "whoa! ah nom nom nom nom" with Matt. Loves to chase Gir. Got Jolly Jumper. Mastering nursing in sling/Ergo but had a few meltdowns anyway.
