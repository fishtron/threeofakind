##Busy summer

The Chedleys travelled to Ontario, Alberta, and around BC this summer.

In July, they attended a reunion of the Dean family and Granny Ankaret Dean’s eightieth birthday in MacDonald’s Corners. The trip was sandwiched between visits to Toronto/St Catharines, where they stayed with Grandma Marilyn and Aunt Louise; and to Quebec on the farm with Aunt Joanna and Uncle David.

On the way back, they stopped in Calgary to attend a friend’s wedding.

Two weeks later, they flew to Castlegar for another wedding and stayed with the Georgets. Russell played with his cousins Ankaret and Kaitlin.

A week later, they drove and ferried to Vancouver Island for a third wedding in Saanichton. They stayed with Basil in Victoria.

In total they were on six flights. They intend to take advantage of the free airfare for Russell while he is under two years old.

##Matthew changes job, stays at Hydro

Matthew took a lateral move within BC Hydro to work for the Standards Department.

He is currently implementing a standard for a fall-arrest system. A fall-arrest system is needed for crews working on equipment high off the ground. If they slip and fall, such a system is designed to prevent serious injuries and death.

##Russell turns one, grows eighth tooth

{% img left /images/2013/02/r_teeth.jpg 380 R has a lot of teeth %}

Russell spawned a total of eight teeth this year, just before he turned one.

If he continues at the same rate, he will have over one hundred teeth by the time he completes high school.

For his first birthday, the Chedleys held a party at home and invited family and friends to attend. He received many sweet gifts and ate a small amount of cake.

##Lois goes back to work, Russell enjoys daycare

After her maternity leave ended, Lois went back to work part time. They managed to find a daycare for Russell as well. Russell enjoyed daycare. On most days, he did not want to come home.

Sadly, near the beginning of December, Russell’s daycare discovered that they could no longer take him because of his young age. They had made a mistake initially in the calculation.

At around the same time, Lois’ company laid off all its staff due to lack of work/money. So the lack of daycare is no longer a problem, but Lois is funemployed as of the new year.

##Russell remains tiny

{% img left /images/2013/02/r_headphones.jpg 380 R is DJing for us %}

Russell weighed in at 7.25kg at the one-year check-up -- just under seventeen pounds. He is in the bottommost one percentile of the WHO weight-by-age chart.

The doctor advises that we feed him ice-cream (which we do) and sweets (which we do). She also recommends PediaSure, a caloriffic concoction designed to meet the energy and nutritional requirements of a growing toddler. Unfortunately, Russell prefers to pour it on himself than to consume it.

##GIR stressed, pukes blood

The Chedley’s pet terrier was hospitalised overnight for bloody vomit and dehydration.

He has developed a phobia of tape measures, and by extension, all things that come out of the garage. He also dislikes having his nails clipped or teeth brushed. With Russell toddling around and making plenty of noise, GIR has spent a lot of time cowering under the humans’ feet, which has increased the incidences of being stepped on, which increases the time he spends cowering.

The Chedleys hope the poor dog adjusts better over time with more exercise and training at home.

##Matt runs for office

Matt is a candidate in the upcoming BC elections. He is running for the Green Party, whose provincial platform most closely aligns with Matt’s values about the environment and economy.

If you would like to chat policy with him, or strategise, or provide some much-needed [financial support](https://greenpartybc.nationbuilder.com/donate_to_matthew_pedley), let us know ;)
