Our babby is eight months already?!

<!-- more -->

April -- Noticeably more willful... if you take a mango away from him while he is enjoying it, he WILL make a scene. Meltdowns around dinner and bed times are common as he discovers he *really* doesn't like sleeping. Started swimming lessons. Bathes in tub with mum & dad like a big boy. :D Survived another roadtrip. Rolls from front &rarr; back and can sit on his own (though wobbly). Some time this month we washed his last poopy diaper. (!!!) Eating solids three or four times a day, typically a couple teaspoonfuls of pureed mango, yams, carrots, peas, chicken, and fish.

May -- Can roll back and forth freely. Rolling, then dragging himself on his elbows, then commando-crawling. Quicker than you'd expect. Loves dog water, potty, computer cables and chasing Gir. Discovered to like lemon, vinegar, and ginger (wtf). Battles with constipation and food intake (distracted nurser &rarr; compensate with solids &rarr; not enough fluids for baby GI system).

June -- Big enough for the baby swing! Unsure about it, though. Often shows preference for mum and dad when around strangers. Fusses when daddy comes home and goes away without kissing him first. Can stand up, propped on his elbows on the coffee table or window ledge. LOVES banging stuff together. Three teeth popped, one more on its way. Can manipulate cheerios into own mouth and likes to feed himself, often fussing when you try to feed him.

Looked at some of his very-baby photos and he looks SO different. Totally amazed. They grow up so fast &lt;sniff&gt;
