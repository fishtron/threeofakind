Almost a year ago we got married... but it's still a big deal for us! We really had a good time. Our friends and family are really awesome.

I wanted to make a list of all the special things that all the special people did to make our special weekend extra special, but realised that the list would be long -- and I'm deathly afraid of forgetting to mention this detail or that, because it all seems special. So instead, here are some special links to some photos and a very special video. Special!

## Professional photos by Gerald Deo
