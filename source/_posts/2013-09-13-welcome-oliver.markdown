There is a new Chedley in the world! He arrived on August 21st and his name is Oliver.

We're not really "three" anymore -- as Russell would say, we're now three, "plus one, plus other one" but for some reason Lois refuses to purchase that web address. Also, "five of a kind" is clearly cheating at poker.

Suggestions for a new blog name, anybody?
