We went to the Okanagan for Easter. Gir loved it as usual -- he has energetic playmates and all walks are off-leash. Unfortunately, all the tearing around has consequences.

We noticed his neurotic licking but only saw the swelling in his paw pads a week after we got back. So we put bitter apple on it. But he noticed that he could lick it off, and did so consistently for two nights. (We'd wake up to slurping sounds in the middle of the night.)

So we put a homemade bandage on it (torn up an old bed sheet) and hoped it would deter his licking -- did not work. In fact, it started bleeding because he was *licking the bandage*, so the friction caused the skin to break open.

I put some polysporin on him and then dragged him to see the vet. Not his favourite place.

Luckily, the vet didn't find any signs of infection, so he just had to get some steroid cream and proper bandages. It's healed fairly quickly; the inflamed areas have returned to the normal colouration and the swelling has almost completely gone away.
