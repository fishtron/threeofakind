Matt and I were certain of what we wanted, though translating them into reality would take a bit of work. We knew we wanted a place where our friends and relatives could stick around for a few days and enjoy the surrounds. We've also heard stories of frugal weddings, to which we would often turn for inspiration. This quickly ruled out a city wedding -- in Vancouver, weddings equal big business, and we'd heard plenty of horror stories of how much other people's weddings cost.

Somehow I got the idea in my head that I wanted to have a sea-side wedding. Orginially I had my sights set on Tofino, BC, a gorgeous surf-town on the western tip of Vancouver Island. I'd looked and looked, but having a wedding during peak-season in Tofino was going to use up pretty much our entire budget.

Matt's mum suggested Silverton, a pretty little town in interior BC where they own a vacation home. It sits on beautiful Slocan Lake, and would be much more affordable. But it would have been somewhat tricky to get to, and though it was a quaint little spot, it was far from the ocean, *dammit*.

Then we remembered Salt Spring Island. Matt and I camped on Ruckle Beach for a few nights one summer. Memories of falling asleep to the sound of waves and finding awesome, quirky foods and arts and crafts around every corner kickstarted us into a search for a wedding-appropriate venue on the largest of the Gulf Islands.

It didn't take us long to find the [Cusheon Lake Resort](http://cusheonlake.com). They were one of the few places big enough to accommodate all of our guests but not so big that we'd feel silly -- we were aiming for a hundred guests -- and, as a bonus, managers Judy and Tom were incredibly nice.

When we visited, the cabins and docks were very enchanting, even though it was sopping wet in December. We discovered another bonus: there was little cell reception and wifi service was limited to the office. Our guests would be trapped! Muahahaha! 

It turned out way better than expected. The [helpful fellas of The Rental Stop](http://rentalstop.ca) set up the tent the day before we arrived, Judy spent upwards of an hour getting us all checked in, the weather was holding up, and the dogs were loving all the spare pieces of roast pig that my Uncle Bill brought.

We were apprehnsive at first -- not everyone loves rusticness as much as we do. But when the date rolled around and we all gathered on the ferry, we knew it was going to be great.
