Matt and I were certain of what we wanted, though translating them into reality would take a bit of work. We knew we wanted a place where our friends and relatives could stick around for a few days and enjoy the surrounds. We've also heard stories of frugal weddings, to which we would often turn for inspiration. This quickly ruled out a city wedding -- in Vancouver, weddings equal big business, and we'd heard plenty of horror stories of how much other people's weddings have cost.

Somehow I got the idea in my head that I wanted to have a sea-side wedding. Orginially I had my sights set on Tofino, BC, a gorgeous surf-town on the western tip of Vancouver Island. I'd looked and looked, but having a wedding during peak-season in Tofino was going to use up pretty much our entire budget.

Matt's mum suggested Silverton, a very pretty town in interior BC where they own a vacation home. It sits on beautiful Slocan Lake, and would have been much more affordable. But it would have been somewhat tricky to get to, and though it was quaint little spot, it wasn't by the ocean, *dammit*.

Finally, we remembered Salt Spring Island. Matt and I camped on Ruckle Beach for a few nights one summer. Memories of falling asleep to the sound of waves and finding awesome, quirky foods and arts and crafts around every corner kicked us into a search for a wedding-appropriate venue on the largest of the Gulf Islands.

It didn't take us long to find the Cusheon Lake Resort. They were one of the few places big enough to accommodate all of our guests -- we were aiming for around 100 --
