I typically don't Blog, but Lois thought it would be nice to share this story with everyone, so here goes...<div><br /></div><div>After spending about 5 months working with a custom&nbsp;jewelery&nbsp;artist I finally had the ring in my pocket the day before Lois and I left for London, UK on September 17th. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as we got to the UK I started to look for the right place and time. I carried the ring around ever day until I popped the question. On the evening of the 22nd I tried to get Lois to join me in a park as the sun set so I could "take pictures" but she decided to go see mer Gooma in the Hospital instead. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div>
